Holmes and Watson's investigations take them across London. Sherlock
deduces that West was murdered elsewhere, then moved to Aldgate
Station to create the illusion that he was crushed on the tracks by
a train. On their way to Woolwich Sherlock dispatches a telegram to
Mycroft at London Bridge: "Send list of all foreign spies known to
be in England, with full address."

While investigating at Woolwich Arsenal Sherlock learns that West
did not have the three keys&mdash;door, office, and
safe&mdash;necessary to steal the papers. The train station clerk
mentions seeing an agitated West boarding the 8:15 train to London
Bridge. Sherlock suspects West of following someone who had access
to the Woolwich chief's keyring with all three keys.

<h3>Citic Tower</h3>
<p>
<img src ="images/2a36c5cd471e954257371df3f8c067bb.jpg">
Holmes deduces that the murderer placed West atop a stopped train at
Caulfield Gardens. The train traveled to Aldgate Station before
West's body finally toppled off. Backtracking to the criminal's
apartment, Holmes finds a series of classified ads from
<em>The Daily Telegraph</em> stashed away. All are under the name
Pierrot: "Monday night after nine. Two taps. Only ourselves. Do not
be so suspicious. Payment in hard cash when goods delivered."

<img src ="images/under-snohetta-underwater-restaurant-architecture-public-leisure-baly-lindesnes-norway_dezeen_2364_col_4-852x568.jpg">
Holmes and Watson head to The Daily Telegraph and place an ad to
draw out the criminal. It reads: "To-night. Same hour. Same place.
Two taps. Most vitally important. Your own safety at stake.

Valentine Walter, the brother of Woolwich Arsenal's chief. He
confesses to working for Hugo Oberstein to obtain the submarine
plans in order to pay off his debts.

<h3>The Twist</h3>

<img src ="images/Bjarke-Ingels-Twist-bridge-museum-Kistefos-art-park-Norway-05-1.jpg">
Walter writes to Oberstein and convinces him to meet in the smoking
room of the Charing Cross Hotel where he promises additional plans
for the submarine in exchange for money. The plan works and Holmes
and Watson catch both criminals.
